# Quick start

This is a quick start guide for getting up and running with `rsx`.

## Introduction

[`rsx`](https://github.com/react-native-contrib/rsx) is a CLI tool built to ease your daily React Native development. Out of the box, it can:

* create new React Native projects
* add, remove and list platform-specific projects using Yeoman generators
* add, remove and list plugins - using the awesome `rnpm` under the hood
* build and run a project for a given platform
* get the status of installed React Native dependencies
* easily extensible
* is community-owned
* is MIT licensed

## Getting Started

Assuming you already have `npm` and `rnpm` installed, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g rsx
```
