# Usage

## Creating a new project

Creating a new React Native project is as simple as:

```bash
$ rsx new AwesomeApp
```

This will create a folder called `AwesomeApp` within the current directory, and then create a React Native project with iOS and Android projects by default.

## Adding a platform

```bash
$ rsx platforms add android
```

## Running a project

```bash
$ rsx run ios
$ rsx run android
```
