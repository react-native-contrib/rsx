**React Starter GearboX** - a CLI tool built to ease your daily React Native development.

## Rationale

Inspired by the `cordova` tool and motivated by how crap the `react-native` CLI tool is. Also a big shoutout to the rnpm guys, most of the code is cribbed from them.

## Requirements

- node >= 4.1

## Documentation

All documentation is available at this project's [GitHub pages](http://react-native-contrib.github.io/rsx/).
